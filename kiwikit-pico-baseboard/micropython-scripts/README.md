## micropython-scripts

In this directory are a number of small micropython scripts you can use to get started with experimenting on the kiwikit-pico-baseboard.

Copy over the at24.py and the ssd1306.py libraries and then you can launch kiwikit.py.

If you're unsure of what to do I recommend perusing the [resources](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-micropython).
